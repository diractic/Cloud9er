# Cloud 9er: Building Platform with Minikube & Origami Transformer

A cloud-based platform for both cloud and local Kubernetes clusters with full-stack support, featuring mood detection, adaptive infrastructure, and origami sprite transformations.

## Innovation Timeline

This project contains several novel technological approaches first developed on March 29, 2025:

1. **Minikube Visualization System**: A new approach to representing Kubernetes architecture as interactive pixel sprites
2. **Origami Transformation Algorithm**: Digital sprites that fold and transform using our proprietary animation system
3. **Mood-Responsive Infrastructure**: Cloud resources that adapt based on detected emotional states

## Key Components

### 1. Minikube Visualization
The application visually represents Kubernetes architecture using pixel sprites that illustrate the relationships between microservices.

```
├── k8s/                      # Kubernetes deployment files
│   ├── backend-deployment.yaml
│   ├── backend-service.yaml
│   ├── frontend-deployment.yaml
│   ├── frontend-service.yaml
│   ├── ml-service-deployment.yaml
│   ├── ml-service-service.yaml
│   ├── mongo-deployment.yaml
│   └── mongo-service.yaml
```

### 2. Origami Transformer
The origami transformer provides animations that fold 2D sprites into different shapes based on detected moods.

```
├── ml-service/                   # ML service for mood detection and sprite transformations
│   ├── origami_transformer.py    # Core transformer logic
│   ├── sprite_creator.py         # Sprite generation
│   └── dream_journal.py          # Journal integration
```

### 3. Mood Detection
Analyzes facial expressions to determine user mood, which affects both sprite visualization and origami transformations.

### 4. Building Platform
The Cloud 9er platform provides a comprehensive environment for creating and deploying applications:
- **Unified Development**: Build applications that work seamlessly across cloud and local clusters
- **Visual Infrastructure**: Design your infrastructure using interactive visual components
- **Mood-Based Training**: The platform learns from developer emotions to optimize environments
- **Adaptive Resources**: Infrastructure that responds to detected mood patterns

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express
- **ML Service**: Python/Flask
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes/Minikube

## Features

- **Sprite Creator**: Design pixel sprites for Kubernetes components
- **Mood Detection**: Analyze facial expressions to determine emotional state
- **Origami Transformations**: Apply folding animations to sprites
- **Kubernetes Journal**: Document deployment architecture with interactive elements
- **Progressive Web App Capability**: Use as both website and installable app
- **Cross-Cluster Support**: Deploy seamlessly across cloud and local environments
- **Mood-Trained Infrastructure**: Development environment that adapts to emotional states
- **Visual Builder Interface**: Create applications through visual components
- **Real-time Resource Adaptation**: Infrastructure that responds to changing needs

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- Python 3.9+
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Minikube

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud9er.git
   cd cloud9er
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. For Kubernetes deployment:
   ```
   minikube start
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

## Developer Guidelines

### Adding New Sprites
Extend the sprite library by adding new templates to `sprite_creator.py`

### Creating New Origami Transformations
New transformation patterns can be added to `origami_transformer.py`

### Mobile and Tablet Touch Interface
The application supports touch interactions for tablets and mobile devices.
